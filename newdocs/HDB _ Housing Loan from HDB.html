<h1>Housing Loan from HDB</h1>



<div class="rte-content">
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>If you need financing to buy or take over the ownership of a flat, you may apply for a housing loan from HDB or the <a href="/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/housing-loan-options/housing-loan-from-financial-institutions">financial institutions (FI)</a>. Understand the <a href="/residential/buying-a-flat/working-out-your-flat-budget/credit-to-finance-a-flat-purchase">key terms and considerations</a>&nbsp;for the different loan options before making a decision.</p>
<p>Apply for an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter via the <a href="https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing">HDB Flat Portal</a>&nbsp;for a holistic understanding of your housing and financing options before you embark on your home buying journey. It will inform you upfront of your eligibility to buy a new or resale flat, as well as the amount of housing grants and HDB housing loan you are eligible for.</p>
<p>Find out the eligibility conditions, credit assessment criteria and important information on the HDB housing loan below.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>For example, if the private residential property was disposed of on 1 July 2024, based on the legal completion date of disposal, you may apply for an HFE letter to buy a flat from HDB, resale Plus or Prime flat, or resale unclassified<sup>[4]</sup>/ Standard  flat with CPF housing grant(s), or take an HDB housing loan on or after 1 January 2027.</p>

            <p>All applicants and occupiers listed in the HFE letter application can, as a household, own or have an interest in up to 1 non-residential property<sup>[5]</sup> at HFE letter application, if they wish to buy a flat from HDB, a resale Plus/ Prime<sup>[6]</sup> flat, or a resale unclassified/ Standard flat with CPF housing grant(s).</p>
            <p>If the applicants and occupiers own or have an interest in more than 1 non-residential property, they must have disposed of the other non-residential properties at least 30 months (counted from the legal completion date of the disposal of the interest) before applying for an HFE letter.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px;">[5] This is regardless of the share of ownership in the non-residential property. If the applicants and occupiers own the same non-residential property, the household is considered as owning 1 non-residential property.<br />

    <li>Use the savings in their CPF OA to pay the stamp fee, registration fee, legal fees, and premium for the CPF Home Protection Insurance (if applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining balance in your CPF OA must be used to pay for the flat purchase or take over ownership of an existing flat, before the HDB housing loan can be granted.</p>
<p>The total amount of CPF savings that can be used to buy or take over the flat and pay the monthly mortgage instalments will depend on:</p>

<p>When the allowed CPF amount is used up, you have to pay for the balance purchase price and/ or the monthly mortgage instalments in cash.

<h2>Monthly repayment</h2>
<p>Upon disbursement of the HDB housing loan, your first monthly instalment payment will start on the first day of the second month. Thereafter, your monthly instalments are due and payable on the first day of every month, until the housing loan is redeemed.</p>
<p>You can use your cash and/ or CPF savings to pay the monthly instalments, subject to the prevailing rules of CPF Board. If you choose to use cash instead of CPF savings, you can grow your retirement fund steadily with CPF interest rates.

<p>A smaller housing loan and paying it off early will give you greater financial flexibility for your other goals (e.g. building up retirement funds, investments, etc.).</p>
<p>To reduce your financial commitments and save on interest payments, you can also make regular partial payments or early repayment of your housing loan, or shorten your repayment period. Your monthly instalment will be adjusted accordingly.

<p>If you take an HDB housing loan to buy or take over ownership of a flat, you will have to buy these insurance policies:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/fire-insurance" target="_self">HDB Fire Insurance Policy</a></li>

</ul>
<p>The HDB fire insurance covers the cost of reinstating damaged internal structures, fixtures and areas built and provided by HDB.  As it does not include home contents such as furniture, renovations and personal belongings, you are encouraged to buy additional home insurance from any insurer if you wish to go further to extend protection over your home contents.  Find out more about the <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/fire-insurance" target="_self">HDB Fire Insurance Policy</a>.</p>
<p>For those who are not taking a housing loan, you are also encouraged to buy a fire and home insurance for your flat. You can do so from any insurer.</p>
<p>The Home Protection Scheme is a mortgage-reducing insurance scheme administered by the CPF Board. It insures CPF members and their families against losing their home, should the policy holder become permanently incapacitated or pass away before the housing loan is paid up.</p>
